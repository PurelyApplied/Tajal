@Al
What is Beez's "work" schedule?
Is he a doorman, or is he just at the bar, ready to intervene when things get too busy?
  Mostly hanging out, doing what needs doing.

@Eric
What are you doing in your day-to-day?
  Lives outside of town, makes friends at bars and drug dens.
  Intimidating and frightening.
  Maybe wanders into the wastes, not far, but farther than most

To the east is the Expanse, the Wild Wastes, the Savage Steppes.
It has a dozen nicknames, but the long and short of it is that the weather is MidWest-harsh,
  and it's where the beast races live.

@Alex
During your time as a scout, you spent a lot of time just the other side of the border.
  What is the biggest threat that area represents?
    Wild animals, extra big-ass Monster Hunter style shit.
    Avoidance is better than confrontation.

  Jo confides in Beez that he killed a man.

Blind Carol:
  Maybe makes a small business identifying magical finds.
  Confidant and sage.

\subsection{Traveling to the Western Front}
  \begin{aloud}
  You are driving one of many supply wagons in a long train on the way to the western front.
  Your wagon, along with the two wagons behind you, contain your squad, the Landslide, as you
    bring up the rear of the supply train.
  It's the mid/late spring, but blessedly dry.
  The weather is as good as you could hope for, when you have to sit behind a team of horses,
    trundling along slower than you would walk.
  \end{aloud}

Call for a DC 20 Wisdom (Vehicle: Land) check.
The card trundles, wobbles, and bumps.

  \begin{aloud}
  To the west lies the Legion of Ayanum, but nearly everyone in calls it the Horde.
  From the rumor mill, you've heard that they're generally xenophobes and have a very magic-focused
    culture and political system.
  You've heard that the country is ruled by a lich, and you've heard that it's ruled by a dragon,
    and you've heard that it's ruled by a parliament, and you've heard that it's ruled by whatever
    wizard killed the last guy in power.
  You know, the rumor mill.
  \end{aloud}

Ask if Beez would keep an ear in politics.
Of so\dots

  \begin{aloud}
  About a year ago, they sent an emissary to the capital.
  They met with the Emperess and her council.
  Word never got out what they talked about, but the group left unhappy.
  Ever since then the military has been shoring up it's western front.
  You've heard that political channels are still open, but it's clear that things in the west are
    headed south, as it were.
  \end{aloud}

Ask if Beez is doing anything in particular while he's riding along.
Ask if he would be alone or if one of the other Landslide would be riding with him.

Take a moment to describe the rest of the crew.
Eagletamer is walking, since the goliath would hardly fit in a cart.
Fari and Quinn love to banter and are riding together in another cart.
Alotel and Imrodel are riding in a companionable silence.

  \begin{aloud}
  Up ahead, you see a Tiefling off to the side of the road,
    walking so leisurely that your wagon is actually catchup up on them.
  They have their thumb out in the inter-universal symbol of the hitchhiker.
  Most humans are jumpy around teiflings, and as a result, tieflings more than any other race tend
    to wear nondescript, baggy robes and hooded cloaks to hide their distinguishing features.
  But this one is just hanging out, brown-orange skin the color of actual copper,
    high-held head sporting small ibex-like horns,
    hair the dark blue of veins pulled back into a tail,
    and a pointed tail swishing as they walk.

  A few wagons ahead, someone upturns a pitcher of something at them.
  They dodge back in time, and while you can't hear the words that are exchanged, it's pretty clear
    the meaning.
  The tiefling tosses their pack onto the ground, taps their chest and holds their arms out in
    an invitation to fight.
  The other wagon keeps moving.

  After the wagon's moved on, the tiefling picks up their pack and, noticing the muck, deflates
    a bit.
  She turns around, and you're close enough now that she catches your eye, looking at you with
    those solid-color tiefling eyes, hers silver.
  She smiles hopelessly, raises her eyebrows, and sticks out her thumb.
  \end{aloud}

DC 20 Vehicle (Land, Wisdom) check.
Something feels off.

Shoot the shit for a while.

Goldie (get it?).
Raven necklace.
Arcanist.

DC 15 Vehicle (Land, Wisdom) check.
Advantage if passed either the previous two.

Throw a wheel.

DC 25 to be fine.

On fail, DC 20 to break down in the trail.

On fail, DC 15 to avoid capsizing.

On fail, DC 10 to avoid crippling one of the horses.

On anything other than a 25 success, Goldie takes off.
``No offense, but neither of us needs me here when your officer gets here.
See you around, big guy.''

If he brings it up, she'll magic it fixed quickly on a DC 20-success.

She gives him a silver for the lift.

\subsection{A breathy visitor}
(Bones)

Life is uneventful after ariving at the forward camp.
Goldie visits once in a while.
You tend some scraps and one broken arm, mostly men getting into eveing scraps.
Non-humans know you as someone who can patch them up without much judgement.

A few weeks in, Goldie arrives at your tent shortly after sunrise.
``Come on.
  Your captain wants to see you.''
If asked how she knows, a runner will appear delivering the same message.

The [needs a name] Lieutenant is arguing inside.
DC 15 Perception to catch the tail of it.

Welcomed, orders given to head west and escort in an emmasary.
At ease, how are you settling in?

Meeting goes on.

Follow-up: escort to the edge of our territory, perhaps a hard day's ride, so two days of easy
  riding.

Asshat Leiutenant has sent / is part of a crew that is going to jump you.
Fighting ensues.
Perhaps the emassary explodes.
Give a non-lethal objective?
\subsection{wip}

The Breath is not an emmasary of war, he's a messanger.

  \begin{aloud}
  ``You misunderstand.
    We do not wish for there to be conflict between us.
    We do not wish for there to be \emph{contact} between us.
    This country and its people are of a disease,
      and if it cannot be cut out, we must not allow it to spread.''
    The humans scowl, while the dragonborn's aide whispers something to him.
  ``I apologize.
    It appears I neglect some of your language's nuance.
    I speak neither metaphor nor insult.
    Our augers have forseen a plague borne from your empire, a disease of blood and of mind.
    We will not allow the pathogen within our borders.
    Your leaders refused our aid in rooting it out, and in respecting your nation's sovereignty,
      we are left at an impasse.''

  ``So what does all of this have to do with you massing your army at the border?''
     asks the Captain.
  ``As I said, you misunderstand.
    You see not an force of invasion, but one of defense.
    Any living thing that approaches the Dragonlands will be swiftly summarily executed.
    Our sorcerers will scorch their bodies and the earth beneath them.
    Our archers will kill every buzzard that would eat their flesh.
    Beginning now, \emph{nothing} [beat] enters the Dragonlands.''

    He speaks the next words quickly and reverently, as if reciting a prayer.
  ``My words are carried on the breath of the Gold Dragon,
      whose wisdom is boundless, whose word is law, and whose will is absolute.''
  \end{aloud}

  He's not going back.
  ``If my lord requires my life, I give it gladly.
    Worry not, however.
    Arrangements have been made for us to parley with the Dwarven kingdom to the north.
    We shall be on our way directly.''

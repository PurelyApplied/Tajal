  \subsection{On the road to what may be}
  \begin{aloud}
    You and Nat fall into a comfortable rhythm over days of travel.
    He fills the hours with song and stories, some of which you've heard but most of which are new to you.
    And your earnestness and enjoyment makes you the perfect audience in his eyes.

    Most nights, you sleep out in the wild.

    Jangles hang just inside the wagon, behind the drivers seat.
    They chime pleasantly, quietly as you travel.

\subsection{A night in Burreldale}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Above, as they stop in towns and perhaps one city, Nat talks to other merchants.
        He seems excited by the news.
  \item After you leave, he mentions that there is an annual meeting of merchants, a big party, and it's on our route.
  \item[] [When you arrive]
  \item The wagon is stopped by an armed guard.
        Two more stand some way away.
        Nat is in the back ``getting ready.''
  \item "Ho there!  You lost, friend?  This road dead-ends in a clearing, and it's a prive night tonight, 'm 'fraid.''  \todo{Flesh out this NPC}
  \item Note Jo's response, if it's suitable as the 'right' one.  If so, rustling in the back makes Rosa concerned.  ''Anyone with you in there?''
  \item See if Jo can work his way into or out of trouble here.  Maybe recognize the cart if Jo mentiones it or BlueMan.  Rosaline approaches to 5-10ft from the cart.
  \item Nat comes out in costume, comical wizard hat, obviously-fake long white beard, and fine robe.
  \item ``It is I, Nathaniel the Magnificent!  Purveyor of wonders, supplier of magical delights, enchanter of the weave and women both, supreme --''
  \item Rosaline smoothly flicks her cudgle through the mud, lobbing a glob at Nat.
  \item ``Oh, look what you've done.''  ``No harm in looking filthy as every woman here knows you are, you old scroat.''  Rosaline grins.
  \item ``You out here all night, then?''  ``I'll be in after sundown.  Plenty of time to find some trouble.''
  \item ``Come find me then, yeah?''  Nat goes to pick up the reins, but Rosaline's hand grabs his wrist.
  \item ``You know the rules.  It's your cart, so you have to say the words.''
  \item ``Ehrm right.  Umm... feed me your line again?''
  \item Either do the callback to the right line, or feel around for a ''right'' passphrase.  Otherwise, ``A private party is the best place for a public nuisance!''

  The clearning
  \begin{aloud}
  All around the edge of the clearning, dozens of other merchant carts have been parked.

  A tall pole in the center, ribbons streaming from it, with men and women dancing around.

  Smaller campfires scattered about.
  The scents of various cookpots hit you from all directions, making your mouth water.

  Many clumps of people, engaged in various activities.
  In one clump, half-dressed men are wrestling, to the cheers of on-lookers.
  In another, a rider looks like he's going to do some tricks, but someone slaps his horse's haunch, causing it to jolt the rider into a stack of dirty cookery.
  In the distance, a holy-man is having a quiet but tense argument with a bookish looking man, who doesn't seem to be aware that the fire behind him flares in time with his gesticulations.

  You realize this is the first time you've seen a group of people with fewer humans than other races.
  There are a great many dwarves, halflings, and gnomes present, and more than the average number of elves, half-elves, and half-orcs.

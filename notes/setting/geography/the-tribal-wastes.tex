\section{The Tribal Wastes}
\headeritem{Structure}{Fractured Clans}

Over the centuries, the beast tribes discovered in The Empire have been,
 if not slaughtered outright, driven east.
A partial misnomer, the Wastes are not a barren desert, but a lush grassland.
However, pockets of Gnolls, Goblins, Trolls, Orcs, Kobolds, Bullywugs, Lizardmen, and
 remnants of the once powerful Yuan-ti make travel into the Wastes lethal for almost
 all who enter it.

Aarakocra and Kenku tribes are also found in the Wastes.
These are often the only safe haven from an onslaught of violence that would befall those
 that must travel the Wastes.

\subsection{Boundary}
The Merlicut Gorge is maybe 1,500 feet across.
(Mississippi in the Quad Cities, give or take.)
Maybe short bridge to Arsenal Island with a redoubt, with the major bridge from there.

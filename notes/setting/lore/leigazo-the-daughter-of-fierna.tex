*"Wh... Why are you doing this?"
 The slurred voice quavered from the gutter.
 None of us had noticed the wretch, unmoving, his body pooling the filth running downhill.
 Or perhaps some had, but assumed that the fires would take him, if that was her will.

 He stood slowly, convulsing, scar-strewn arms twitching over an exposed, emaciated stomach.
 A thunder-scratch addict, then.
 I remembered the throbbing that drug once brought me, wave after wave of ecstasy crashing into me
  as I lay in a gutter indistinguishable from his.

"Leigáz wills it, friend."
 I smiled at him as his eyes searched mine, the smile a father gives a child.
 He stared uncomprehending, horrified as the fires began to burn the building behind me in earnest.
 He backed away, tripping to sprawl backwards over the gutter he occupied only moments ago.

"Hush, friend.
 Fear not.
 The fire does not harm the faithful."
 I knelt down, extending my charred hand from my robe and placing it in the tangled nest of scars
  in crook of the man's elbow.
 He flinched.
 I had, too, all those years ago.

"Light of Phlegethos," I intoned, "show this man your warmth.
 Instill in him your burning passion."
 My blackened hand blurred as it heated over the span of two heartbeats,
  before the flames took hold once again.
 "Burn away his impurity."

 I watched as the man's eyes flickered through the emotions.
 The fear of the fire and repulsion at the smell of burning flesh, hair, and filth fled quickly,
  replaced by surprise and confusion that he remained unharmed.
 Then I felt her touch, the sweet release as Leigáz herself entered and claimed my mind.
 I was adrift in her, every other concern eradicated by the river of fire that blazed me.
 I could see that he felt her too.
 His eyes grew wide, his head falling back, and a slow moan falling from an agape mouth.

"Your mortal dalliances are so quaint."
 She spoke with my tongue, saw through my eyes, wreathing each in her flame.
 The light danced madly as I spoke.
"But Abriymoch has stood for eternities.
 We have so much more to offer you."
 The man's response was emphatic, wordless mumbling.
 His slid slowly back into his gutter, eyes rolling back into his head.

By the morning, the entire eight ward of Thornholm would be ash, the worst of our opposition burned away.
By midday, this man would awaken with a singular focus, to feel again what he had briefly tasted.
By evening, he would either find us and join our order,
 or he would lose whatever is left of his mind as the cold invaded where her warmth had been.

I stood.
There was much more to do through the ward tonight.
Other buildings to burn, other wayward souls to enlighten, several remaining deaths to ensure.

As she wills it.

*"Wh... Why are you doing this?"
 The slurred voice quavered from the gutter.
 None of us had noticed the wretch, unmoving, his body pooling the filth running downhill.
 Or perhaps some had, but assumed that we were too late.

 He stood slowly, convulsing, scar-strewn arms twitching over an exposed, emaciated stomach.
 A thunder-scratch addict, then.
 I shuddered, remembered the throbbing that drug once brought me, wave after wave of agony splitting my skull
  after the high had passed, shivering in a gutter indistinguishable from his.

"Enyhítő's light has led me to you, friend."
 I smiled at him as his eyes searched mine, the sad smile a mother gives an injured child.
 He stared uncomprehending, eyeing the bread I offered him as though it were a weapon.
 He backed away, tripping to sprawl backwards over the gutter he occupied only moments ago.

"Hush, friend.
 Come.
 This will help."
 I knelt down, offering the man the fresh loaf.
 He flinched.
 I tore a piece off and ate it, nodding and motioning for him to do the same.

"Nothing helps," he mumbled.

"This will," I insisted.
 I placed my hand over the loaf and focused on Her Divine Radiance.



"Light of Phlegethos," I intoned, "show this man your warmth.
 Instill in him your burning passion."

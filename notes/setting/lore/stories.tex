\subsection{The Drifter}

We all know the gods work wonders, to their own ends and for their own designs.
But there are other beings, too, not gods, but powerful beings from beyond our world.
The demon of the abyss, the devils of the nine hells,
  the tricksters of the Faewild, the arbiters of justice high in Mount Celestia in the seven heavens\ldots
The whole of creation and beyond teems with life, and every life has its desires.
And when the desires of these terrible, powerful creatures cross each other, it is here,
  in our world, that they settle their scores.

In the early days of the world, the gods and their power were closer.
And in those days, there was an powerful kingdom of sorcerers.
The miracles the least of them wrought would make the most powerful wizard today weep.

And in their wisdom and power, they sought to defeat death itself, for what do mortals desire more
  than to cast off their own mortality?

Ilmater, got of endurance

Talona, goddess of disease and poison.
